1. The vehicle_length and ground_clearance are the most likely to provide a non-random amount of variance as their slopes are significantly larger than the other factors. 
2. The slope is considered nonzero because the p-value of 5.35e-11 is significantly less than the standard confidence interval of 0.05%. We are able to reject our null hypothesis because of this. 
3. The linear model does have a strong linear correlation for mpg to the other factors, which is indicated by an r-squared value of 0.71.
